    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    Billions of videos are online ready to be viewed and shared.
    Among the enormous volume of videos, some popular ones are widely viewed by the online users while the majority attract little attention.
    Furthermore, within each video, different segments may attract significantly different number of views.
    This phenomena leads to a challenging yet important problem,
    namely <b>fine-grained video attractiveness prediction</b>,
    which only relies on the video content to forecast video attractiveness at fine-grained levels,
    specifically video segments of the length of \( 5 \) seconds in this paper. <br /><br />
    However, one major obstacle for such a challenging problem is that no suitable benchmark dataset currently exists.
    To this end, we construct the first fine-grained video attractiveness dataset (FVAD),
    which is collected from one of the most popular video websites, <a href="https://v.qq.com/">Tencent Video</a>.
    In total, the constructed FVAD consists of <b>\(1019\)</b> drama episodes with <b>\(780.6\)</b> hours covering different categories and a wide variety of video content.
    Apart from the large amount of videos, hundreds of millions user behaviors while watching videos are also included,
    such as "view counts", "fast-forward", "fast-rewind", and so on, where "view counts" reflects the video attractiveness while other engagements capture the interactions between the viewers and videos.
    <ul>
        <li>First, we demonstrate that video attractiveness and the different engagements present different relationships.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>Second, FVAD  provides us an opportunity to study the fine-grained video attractiveness prediction problem.</li>
    </ul>
    We design different sequential models to perform video attractiveness prediction by relying solely on video content.
    The sequential models exploit the multimodal relationships between visual and audio components of the video content at different levels.<br /> <br />
    Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed sequential models on different visual and audio representations,
    the necessity of incorporating the two modalities, as well as the complementary behaviors of the sequential prediction models at different levels.
    As a side contribution, the FVAD dataset will be released to facilitate researchers to improve fine-grained video attractiveness prediction.

    <h3>Video attractiveness and engagements data</h3>
    The other 9 types of  viewers' engagements with the video sequences while watching.
    Also the view counts are also presented together with each engagement.
    It can be observed that the view counts present different correlations with these 9 types of viewers' engagements. <br />

        <li>Exit: the number of viewers exiting the show</li>
